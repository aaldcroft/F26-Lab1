num2=input("Please enter another number for num2")
print(type(num1))
print(type(num2))

# Convert the values to integers using int() function
num1=int(num1)
num2=int(num2)

# TO-DO 2:
# Perform all arithmetic oeprations as outlined in the description in README.md file, and print in the required format.
print("num1+num2 =",num1+num2)
print("num1-num2 = ",num1-num2)
print("num1*num2 = ",num1*num2)
print("num1**num2 =",num1**num2)
print("num1/num2 =", num1/num2)
print("num1//num2 =",num1//num2)
print("num1%num2 = ",num1%num2)
